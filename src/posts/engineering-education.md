Engaging Students with Engineering Activities

This article is based on an educational project led by educators from the local community of Hilltown and Stobswell. 

The project gathered educators, teachers and local organisations to discuss and promote engineering and technology resources and activities with young people

A website was created to promote the work:

<https://hilltownstobswell.tech>

The focus was on creating inclusive approaches to engineering and technology.

The working group developed the following resources and activities:

Makerspaces: designing and creating workbenches for practical activities, sourcing tools and materials
